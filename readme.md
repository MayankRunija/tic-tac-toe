This project aims to create a simple and fun Tic Tac Toe game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Tic Tac Toe is a classic game that has been enjoyed by generations of players. 
The objective of the game is to place X's or O's in a 3x3 grid, with the goal of getting three in a row.

The first step is to create the HTML structure for the game board.
This will consist of a 3x3 grid of squares, which will be represented by div elements with the class "square". 
Each square will also have an ID that corresponds to its position on the grid (e.g., "square-1-1" for the top left square).

Next, we'll add some CSS to make our game look nice. 
We'll give the squares a border, set their width and height, and center them on the page. 
We'll also add some styles to make the X's and O's look good when they're added later. 
We'll use CSS classes to represent each player's symbol (X or O).

Finally, we'll add the JavaScript code that makes the game work. 
The first step is to define some variables that will keep track of the game state, 
such as the current player and the positions of the X's and O's on the board. 
We'll also add event listeners to the squares, so that when a player clicks on a square,
we'll know which one was clicked and we can update the game accordingly.

We'll create a function called "playTurn" that will handle each turn of the game. 
This function will alternate between the X and O players, and will update the game board with the player's symbol.
We'll also check for a win after each turn by checking if there are three in a row of the same symbol.
If a win is detected, we'll display a message announcing the winner and disable further clicks on the board. 
If the game ends in a tie, we'll display a message announcing the tie.

Creating a Tic Tac Toe game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript is a great way to practice your front-end development skills.
By breaking the game down into HTML structure, CSS styling, and JavaScript logic, 
we can create a fun and interactive game that can be enjoyed by players of all ages.
